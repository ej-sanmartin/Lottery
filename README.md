Description

Simple Java Lottery Game Based on Guessing Numbers and Hoping You Get It Right!!

In this project, I wrote a server side Java code that takes in an input of movies with their information, where you could then view the individual movies or the list of movies or "rent" a movie. This project was my chance to practice writing Java code in Eclipse and learn the fundamentals of the programming language. Completed through the Udemy course "Computer Science for Beginners Learn by Building 6 Java apps" (url: https://www.udemy.com/computer-science-for-everyone/learn/v4/content)

To run the program, you must have latest version of Eclipse installed (url: https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).


Instructions to Run Program
-----------------------
